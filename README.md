# Planet_Orbital_Motion_Simualtion
## Introduction
While there exists an analytical solution for the 2-body problem, there is none for the 3-body problem or the N-body problem. This programe simulates the behaviour and the evolutions of the Planets in the Solar System. As no exact solution exists for this problem numerical methods have been used. For the purpose of the animation, the method used it known as the Beeman's Algorithm which is a symplectic integrator (Based on the Hamiltonian).
## Installation
Please Make sure that you have `Python 3` installed.`Numpy` and `Matplotlib` packages are also used in this program and should be installed.
## Tests
To run the tests please first go to the test directory by `cd  test` or other, then you may run `py -m unittest discover` to run all the tests, if you are in linux you might want to use `python` instead of `py`.
Please do not try to run the tests from the root directory.
